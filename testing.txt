Sure, here is a PC config that I would recommend for programming, running servers, and machine learning:

* CPU: Intel Core i5 13600K
* GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060
* RAM: 32GB DDR4-3200
* Motherboard: MSI B660M Mortar WiFi
* Storage: 1TB Samsung 980 Pro NVMe SSD + 2TB Seagate Barracuda HDD
* Power Supply: Corsair RM850x
* Case: NZXT H510i

This configuration will give you plenty of power for programming, running servers, and machine learning. The CPU has 6 cores and 12 threads, which is perfect for multitasking. The GPU has 12GB of GDDR6 memory, which is enough for even the most demanding machine learning tasks. The RAM is 32GB, which is plenty for even the most demanding programming projects. The motherboard has all the features you need for a high-performance PC, including support for PCIe Gen 4, Wi-Fi 6, and Bluetooth 5. The storage is a mix of a fast NVMe SSD for your operating system and programs, and a large HDD for your data. The power supply is 850 watts, which is enough to power all of your components even under heavy load. The case is a mid-tower case with good airflow and cable management.

This is just a recommended configuration, and you may need to adjust it depending on your specific needs and budget. However, this configuration will give you a powerful PC that can handle anything you throw at it.1452> **Can you recommend me a PC config for programming, running server and machine learning** - <@950354453033263175>
